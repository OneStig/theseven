        Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
        My name is Steven, and I&apos;m an undergrad studying CS at UC Irvine.
        Most of the time I&apos;m learning about or working with all things algorithms
        so I can build cool projects and compete in programming contests.
        Feel free to contact me if you&apos;d like to talk to me about anything related to programming
        (ICPC, compilers, pedagogy etc.), powerlifting,
        or <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/8o0ew1">backpacking</a>!
      </p>
